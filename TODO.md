## Known issues in `dqrobotics` lessons

1. Originally, the lessons written in `MATLAB` did not allow the use of latex macros. This means that the conversion from those to Jupyter notebooks brought notation as-is, which is not entirely compliant with the [latest notation](https://github.com/IncompleteGuides/lyx-macros). This is a very time-consuming task, so it will only be attempted with community support or further funding sources.
2. The current `plot` method
   using `dqrobotics-pyplot` in the Jupyter notebook is generating a phantom image besides the animation videos.
   There are instructions online that allow us to tackle this issue, but I haven't been able to find one
that properly shows the video but not the image.
3. The latex macros in all lessons do not seem to render well in `jupyterlab`. It's not yet clear to me why.
