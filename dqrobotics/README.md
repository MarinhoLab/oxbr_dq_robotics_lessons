# Kinematic modeling and control of serial-link robotic manipulators using `dqrobotics` Python: From zero to hero.

This executable book contains eight lessons representing serial-link manipulator modeling in dual quaternions using `dqrobobotics` described in http://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2020.2997920. It is a derivative
work of a [`dqrobotics` MATLAB course](https://github.com/dqrobotics/learning-dqrobotics-in-matlab/tree/master/robotic_manipulators) from Murilo M. Marinho.

The theory used in this book is described in works such as [@adorno:tel-00641678], [@vilhenaadorno:hal-01478225], and https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2019.2920078.

# Using this book

Each lesson is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html). Each lesson can be
downloaded, opened, and executed with popular IDEs, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
The reader is expected to follow it sequentially.
